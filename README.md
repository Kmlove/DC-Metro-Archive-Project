# DC-Metro-Archive-Project

## UserStory
DC Metro Archive (DCMA) is an interactive guide to having a fun weekend (or just changing up your routine) in DC! 

The landing page will display a random recommended spot of the day. You can navigate around our side using the nav bar to see different resturants and events happening around DC. Users will be able to add new events and resturants to the site. They can also update any outdated information on the site and remove events that have passed or resturants that have closed. We hope you enjoy your visit to DC!

## Database
We will be creating our own db.json that will look similar to below:

## MVP
User will be able to:
* C: add information about locations in their city 
* R: read extant information from the server
* U: update outdated info 
* D: delete irrelevant info
 
Client Side Routing & Purpose:
* Landing page with recommended spot of the day - path = "/"
* Restaurants - path = "/restaurants"
* Free Things - path = "/free"
* Events - path = "/events"

Components:
* App
* Landing page
* Restaurants
  * Subcomponents for specific restaurants
* Free Things
* Events
  * Subcomponents for events/data on events

## Strech Goals
1. User comments for restaurants  (would need new database)
2. User comments for events  (would need new database)
3. Weather in this city (external API)
